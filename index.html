          <h2>The social way to learn English and develop your conversation skills in a relaxed and fun environment with native English speakers.</h2>
          <p>Practising face-to-face conversation is the most effective and enjoyable way to learn a new language and develop fluency. We meet once a week with the aim of improving our English language skills, whilst also enjoying ourselves, with proven results for those attending regularly.</p>
          <p>Welcome to our group, feel free to join us!</p>
          <p class="covid"><em>Note regarding Coronavirus restrictions:<br>All current government advice, guidelines and rules are applied.</em></p>

          <h2>Improve your English speaking and listening skills with native English speakers!</h2>
          <p>The group's organiser is a native English speaker from London, with other native English guest speakers and contributors joining us regularly. The meetings give real-life opportunities to engage in social interaction with native English speakers, with the extra advantage of improving cross-cultural communication.</p>
          <p>Understanding the culture of a native speaker will assist with understanding why and how the language is used. Practising with native speakers will also give a better grasp of the language as it is used outside of the classroom.</p>

          <h2>Learn about new subjects in English, expand your knowledge and vocabulary!</h2>
          <p>The meetings’ conversations are a mixture of free-form discussion about our lives, current affairs and what is happening locally or in the rest of the world, as well as structured debate of topics with questions prepared by the group organiser.</p>
          <p>Previous discussions have included subjects such as idioms, art, leadership, love, power, freedom, travelling, human rights, dreams, climate change, ambition, feminism, music, amongst many others.</p>
          <p>Do you have an interesting subject to discuss? We’d love to know!</p>
